## 2026-06-11 — R0/R1 bootstrap

### Objective

Start an evidence-gated implementation that can validate the core contract before adding dense, graph, TDB, or LLM indexing experiments.

### Current hypothesis

The first useful milestone is not semantic retrieval. It is a trustworthy local evidence kernel with traceability, citation validation, and file-backed context-lite.

### Stage gates

- R0 passes when every returned result is traceable as `EvidenceCore` and citation validation can verify path/range/hash.
- R1 passes when read, repo scan, regex search, and context-lite work without remote dependencies.

### Implementation notes

- Initialized a Rust workspace with separate crates for core contracts, repo IO, retrieval, and CLI.
- Implemented `EvidenceCore` as the stable output contract: `path`, `start_line`, `end_line`, `content_sha`, `score`, `why`, `channels`.
- Kept `EvidenceMeta` optional so policy/freshness/excerpt/language metadata can evolve without breaking core evidence.
- Implemented local-only policy defaults and basic `.openlocus/policy.toml` loading.
- Implemented trace JSONL output under `.openlocus/traces/` for command-level observability.
- Implemented file reads with range parsing and symlink escape protection.
- Implemented repo scanning with default ignores, policy include/exclude, and gitignore control.
- Implemented line-based regex/text search. A review caught an early over-wide span design; it was corrected so each matched line returns a narrow Evidence span.
- Implemented citation validation for single Evidence, Evidence arrays, and `{ evidence: [...] }` packs, including range/hash/excerpt checks.
- Implemented context-lite file creation as an initial file-backed session fact surface.

### Review findings resolved

- **Search span precision**: fixed broad first-match-to-last-match spans; regex/text search now returns per-line evidence.
- **Citation validation**: now validates path, range, current file hash, and excerpt consistency.
- **Path safety**: existing targets are canonicalized to prevent symlink escapes outside the repo.
- **Freshness correctness**: search evidence hashes the bytes actually read for the match, avoiding stale scan-record hashes.
- **Policy basics**: scan include/exclude and `include_gitignored` now affect scan behavior.

### Verification

```text
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --workspace
openlocus read README.md:1-3 --json
openlocus citations validate /tmp/openlocus-evidence.json --json
openlocus search regex OpenLocus --json
openlocus citations validate /tmp/openlocus-search.json --json
openlocus context-lite --write-files --json
python3 eval/run_retrieval.py --dataset fixtures/smoke.jsonl --out runs/smoke-rg.jsonl --openlocus target/debug/openlocus
python3 eval/score.py --pred runs/smoke-rg.jsonl
```

All Rust checks passed. CLI smoke eval returned success rate `1.0`.

### Caveats carried forward

- Regex search is intentionally line-based in R1; multiline regex spanning line boundaries is not supported yet.
- Context-lite currently writes minimal placeholder files; deeper dirty/test/diagnostics ingestion belongs in a later hardening pass.
- Policy globbing is intentionally simple and should be replaced with a mature matcher before broad user-facing use.
- Trace events are command-level and not yet full replayable retrieval trajectories.
