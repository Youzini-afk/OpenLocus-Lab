# OpenLocus Research Summary

This document will be updated after each evidence-gated stage.

## Stage status

| Stage | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| R0 Research Harness | Passed initial gate | EvidenceCore/EvidenceMeta, trace JSONL, citation validation, and smoke eval harness are implemented. |
| R1 Local Evidence Kernel | Passed initial gate | Local read, repo scan, line-based regex/text search, policy basics, path safety, and context-lite file output are implemented without remote dependencies. |
| R2 Retrieval Method Bakeoff | Passed oracle review | BM25 (Tantivy), simple symbol search, and RRF fusion added. BM25 uses line-scoring, stale-hash skip, no-overlap skip. Symbol uses boundary delimiters. RRF merges wider metadata into narrower survivors. Eval harness reports file/line/span metrics and citation validity; Rust CLI validator provides hash/excerpt-backed citation validation. |
| R3 Level0 Storage Scaffold | Passed Level0 conformance | Store traits + StoreHit materialization gate + ConservativeChunkStore + TDB Level0 placeholder. Materialization rejects empty sha / stale / invalid hits, produces citation-valid Evidence from single file read (TOCTOU-safe). |
| R4 Level0 Derived Safety | Passed oracle review | DerivedIndexView model + deterministic rule generator + policy/citation/freshness gates + JSONL store. data_level hard-gated ≤1. Secret-like tokens filtered. High-risk kinds disabled. View IDs include policy_mode/generator_version. Stale mutation detected. JSONL parse errors surfaced. No quality claim. |
| R5 Level0 Graph Scaffold | Passed oracle review | GraphEdge carries source_content_sha/source_language. Materialization via StoreHit → openlocus_store::materialize_evidence (not hand-built). Invalid ranges rejected (not clamped). build_graph validates paths/sha, builds safe_records only. Depth=1 only. Channel::Graph. Citation-valid evidence. Not a precise semantic/call graph. |
| R6 Level0 Fast Context | Passed oracle review | 4-turn deterministic loop (lexical → symbol → graph → RRF fusion). EvidencePack-compatible output with trace_id. ActionRecord per-channel replay. Token budget (chars/4). Unknown channel gate. Final citation validation drops invalid. Orchestration scaffold only, not learned agent. |
| R7 Persistent BM25 Index + Warm SLO | Passed Level0 smoke (after oracle review gates) | Persistent Tantivy index at .openlocus/index/tantivy/ with mandatory manifest at .openlocus/index/manifest.json. schema_version=r7-bm25-v1. Search/open refuse if manifest is missing or policy_hash/schema mismatches. validate_path on every hit before file read. Empty content_sha → skip. Strict range (1≤start≤end≤total_lines, no clamp). build_index filters unsafe paths. PersistentBm25Index keeps the Index/searcher open and is reused by bench warm. Warm open=1ms, query p50=1ms. Bench invalid_citations uses real citation validation (hash/range/excerpt/freshness). 32/32 safety checks passed. Level0 implementation notes only; not a general performance claim. |

## R0/R1 initial findings

- Evidence precision matters immediately: the first regex implementation returned over-wide line ranges for distant matches in one file. This would have harmed token waste and Span F0.5. The fix moved R1 regex/text search to one narrow Evidence per matching line.
- Citation validation must validate more than hashes. Range validity and excerpt consistency are needed to catch incorrect spans.
- Path safety is part of evidence safety. Symlink escape protection is required before treating read output as verified current evidence.
- The current local baseline is intentionally boring: no dense, graph, TDB, or LLM indexing has been added yet. This keeps R0/R1 suitable as the control group for later bakeoffs.

## R2 findings

- **BM25 substantially improves file-level recall on the current self-referential fixture**: 0.39 vs 0.21 at k=1, 0.86 vs 0.36 at k=5.
- **Symbol search is high-precision but narrow**: only activates for definition-style queries, but when it fires, line precision is the highest of all methods (0.39) and wrong_span_rate is 0.0.
- **RRF fusion approaches BM25-level recall** while incorporating symbol precision, achieving 0.82 FileRecall@5 and 0.057 SpanF0.5@10 on the current fixture.
- **All methods produce structurally citation-valid evidence in the Python scorer**; aggregated current R2 output was also validated by the Rust CLI citation validator with `0` invalid citations (hash/range/excerpt checked).
- **Token waste is high** (~0.92) because evidence spans are often near-but-not-on narrow gold spans.
- **CLI end-to-end latency** (not warm-index): regex ~13ms, BM25 ~113ms, symbol ~161ms, RRF ~272ms.

## R3 findings

- **Materialization gate is essential and works**: empty sha rejected, stale hits rejected, invalid ranges rejected, TOCTOU-safe (sha + excerpt from same bytes), produced Evidence is citation-valid.
- **TOCTOU safety matters**: reading file bytes once and deriving both sha and excerpt from that single read prevents a modification between reads from producing inconsistent evidence.
- **ConservativeChunkStore validates paths and skips bad records**: traversal paths rejected, stale content_sha skipped, empty files produce no invalid chunks.
- **TDB placeholder provides clean Level0 surface**: returns available=false, success=false with descriptive errors, never panics.
- **This is a Level0 storage scaffold**, not a full storage bakeoff or TDB comparison.

## R4 findings

- **Safety scaffold works**: all gates are functional and block by default. High-risk kinds blocked, data_level hard-gated at ≤1 for Level0, experimental opt-in required, no remote calls.
- **Deterministic view IDs include policy_mode and generator_version**: same source/kind/generator/data_level/policy_mode/generator_version always produces the same ID; change in any produces different ID.
- **No raw full code at data_level ≤ 1**: derived text contains only metadata (line range, language, first identifier). Prevents accidental exposure in derived artifacts.
- **Secret-like tokens are aggressively filtered**: identifiers containing SECRET/TOKEN/PASSWORD/API_KEY/PRIVATE_KEY, or with prefixes sk_/ghp_/AKIA, or long high-entropy mixed strings are not emitted in tags or aliases.
- **JSONL parse errors are surfaced** (not silently skipped): `derived validate` reports parse_errors count.
- **Stale mutation is detected**: building views, modifying a source file, then validating correctly reports stale views.
- **DerivedIndexView is NOT Evidence**: cannot bypass StoreHit/materialize_evidence gate. Any future derived search must materialize source evidence.
- **This is a Level0 safety scaffold only. No quality claim about derived view relevance or usefulness.**

## R5 findings

- **StoreHit materialization gate is essential**: graph edges are converted to StoreHit and delegated to `openlocus_store::materialize_evidence()`. This ensures consistency with all other materialization paths and prevents hand-built Evidence from bypassing validation.
- **GraphEdge carries build-time sha and language**: source_content_sha and source_language allow the materializer to detect stale edges and reject invalid ranges (not clamp them).
- **build_graph validates paths and current sha**: safe_records with validated path and current sha are used for all edge builders (imports, tests, configures). Stale and path-unsafe records are counted and skipped, producing no edges.
- **Simple line-based import parsing works for Rust/Python repos**: mod/use, import/from lines are easy to parse and resolve against the path_set.
- **Config edges are noisy but bounded**: Cargo.toml/package.json link broadly to nearby source files in the fixture. This favors recall but can create many false positives; no general precision/recall claim is made.
- **Depth=1 only; depth>1 returns clear error**: not silently expanded.
- **graph inspect wraps output with artifact marker**: `artifact="graph_edges_not_evidence"` makes it clear these are not citation-valid Evidence.
- **This is a Level0 deterministic scaffold only. Not a precise call graph, type graph, or dependency graph.**

## R6 findings

- **4-turn deterministic loop works as orchestration scaffold**: lexical → symbol → graph → RRF fusion produces multi-channel evidence without any LLM planner.
- **Symbol turn is conditionally activated**: skipped when query lacks identifier-like tokens, avoiding wasted computation.
- **Token budget enforced**: `--budget N` uses chars/4 approximation; evidence trimmed from bottom if cumulative tokens exceed budget. `--max-evidence` is separate count cap.
- **Unknown channel gate**: channels outside regex/text/bm25/symbol/graph are rejected with clear error.
- **Final citation validation**: evidence filtered through `is_citation_valid` before output; invalid dropped and counted in `diagnostics.invalid_citations_dropped`.
- **EvidencePack-compatible output**: `pack` field with trace_id, budget_used. `evidence` field preserved for direct access.
- **ActionRecord per-channel replay**: each turn/channel recorded with query, result_count, latency_ms, optional error. Written to `.openlocus/traces/fast-context-<trace_id>.json`.
- **Confidence derived from top RRF score**: low confidence (<0.1) triggers a missing_question.
- **Orchestration scaffold only, not learned agent.** No adaptive re-querying, no feedback loops, no LLM planning.

## R7 findings

- **Persistent Tantivy BM25 index with manifest works**: build creates .openlocus/index/tantivy/ + .openlocus/index/manifest.json. status/validate/search/purge CLI commands all functional.
- **Manifest and policy gates enforced**: search_persistent_bm25 and PersistentBm25Index::open require the manifest and check manifest policy_hash/schema against current Policy/schema; refuse search if manifest is missing or mismatched. validate_index reports policy_hash_matches=false. Eval confirms: policy change after build → search refuses, validate detects mismatch; manifest deletion → search refuses.
- **Stale/deleted hits are skipped, not emitted**: search_persistent_bm25 re-reads every hit's current file, computes content_sha, and skips mismatches. No stale VerifiedCurrent evidence is ever produced.
- **Empty content_sha bypass prevented**: Hits with empty index_content_sha are skipped (invalid_hits_skipped++), cannot bypass stale check.
- **validate_path on every Tantivy hit**: Before reading a file from a Tantivy hit's path, validate_path is called. Invalid paths → skip. build_index also filters unsafe FileRecord paths.
- **Strict range validation, no clamping**: Chunk ranges must satisfy 1 ≤ start ≤ end ≤ total_lines. Invalid ranges → skip (invalid_hits_skipped++), not clamped.
- **Manifest enables fast staleness detection**: status_index quickly checks all indexed files' current sha against manifest entries. validate_index reports specific stale/deleted/path_unsafe files.
- **Policy exclusion works end-to-end**: .env and *.pem files are excluded by scan_repo, never indexed, and never appear in persistent search output.
- **Warm benchmark is honest**: PersistentBm25Index::open opens the Index/searcher once; same handle reused for all queries with no per-query Index::open. index_open_ms measures open cost only (1ms). index_build_ms reported separately if build was needed. invalid_citations uses real citation validation (hash/range/excerpt/freshness check), not just range.
- **Warm query latency**: On the current small self-referential workspace snapshot, warm queries take 1-2ms per query after index is opened. Open cost is 1ms.
- **Safety is preserved**: Every persistent search hit is re-verified against the current filesystem. The Tantivy stored body is never used as the final excerpt.
- **Purge is safe**: Only deletes known R7 artifact paths under .openlocus/index/. Canonicalizes paths and refuses to delete if index_dir escapes repo root.
- **This is a Level0 implementation only. No incremental update; build is always full rebuild. Warm SLO numbers are from a small self-referential codebase; not a general performance claim. R7 Level0 passed only after oracle review gates.**
